# Tellurian

## The Band

A brief introduction

### History

_TELLURIAN_ started in late 2019 (right before the COVID-19 pandemic) which was not the best of beginnings when starting a fresh band trying to keep the creative momentum going.

#### Asger `Bass`

Asger started out playing guitar way back in the day and shifted to bass in 2017 as his band at the time was missing a bass player. Asger has been playing bass ever since.

#### Glen `Guitar`

Glen picked up the guitar at a very early age and has been shredding ever since.

#### Christopher `Drums`

Christopher started playing drums at age 10 with a long hiatus in his 20's to pursue things outside music, but returned to playing music in 2018.

#### You? `Vocals`

_TELLURIAN_ currently does not have a vocalist, so music created by the band is mainly sung by Christopher with guests vocals from friends.
