## Finding Time

Being in a band is an incredible journey, but it's not always easy to balance our music career with the other demands of life. As parents, finding time to practice, write music, and perform can be especially challenging. We often feel like we're juggling multiple responsibilities at once, and it can be hard to find the energy and focus to create music on top of everything else.

In addition to being parents, many of us also have day jobs or other careers that we must balance with our music. This can be tough, especially when work and family obligations compete for our time and attention.

Finding inspiration to write music can also be a challenge, given the other demands on our time. We often have to be creative and flexible in order to make the most of the time we have, whether it means writing lyrics on our lunch break or practicing after the kids go to bed.

Despite the challenges, we've found that establishing a routine is key to staying productive and making progress towards our creative goals. By setting aside dedicated time for music each day or week, we can ensure that we're consistently making progress and staying connected to our creative vision.

We've also learned to prioritize and delegate, which helps us stay focused on what matters most. Sometimes that means saying no to certain opportunities or delegating some tasks to bandmates or other collaborators. By letting go of the non-essential tasks and focusing on the most important things, we can make the most of our time and stay on track towards our creative goals.

Finding balance between music, parenthood, and other responsibilities is an ongoing process, and it requires patience, creativity, and flexibility. But by staying focused on what matters most and working together as a band, we know that we can continue to create meaningful music and build a fulfilling career while still being present for our families and other important parts of our lives.
