## Introduction

_TELLURIAN_ consists of Glen on guitar, Asger on bass and Christopher on drums.

We met playing for a previous band and decided to start this band together.

The reason was to explore new ideas more freely outside the predefined genre of the former band.

## Starting from scratch

It's always daunting starting from nothing, picking a name, writing some ideas and get a sense for what the band wants to sound like. Setting up a website, figuring out the social media stuff. There's no easy way to do it but to do it.

For us it went something like this:

1. Write some music
2. Write a hundred band names into a spreadsheet
3. Pick a name
4. Pick a different name
5. Write more music to inspire a name
6. Go back to the first name because it grew on you
7. Grab the social media pages before anyone else takes the name
8. Get a domain name for a website
9. Make a website
10. Forget to write music because everything else is taking up too much time
11. write a blog post about it?

## Independence

We agreed early on to produce and release everything ourselves. This means everything wrong the creative process all the way to getting the music released on all the popular platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.

However there's quite a few steps inbetween going from having 2 riffs and a topline to a fully written and produced song with tight recordings and a punchy mix.

A few areas where we have to grow is getting good recording quality and learning to mix and master. Luckily there are fantastic tutorials to get the basic, but every mix is different so getting the fundamentals down only gets us so far.

But with no previous releases and no deadlines we have plenty of time to figure this out before we release anything.

No previous releases essentially means we get to do exactly what we want without the expectations of anyone.
