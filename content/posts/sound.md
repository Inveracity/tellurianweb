## Finding our sound

As a metal band, finding our signature sound has been a journey of experimentation and discovery. We've spent countless hours exploring different gear and playing techniques to create a sound that is uniquely ours.

Our gear is a crucial part of our sound. Glen and Asger have carefully selected their guitars to achieve the tone that defines our music. Effects pedals like distortion, delay, and reverb help us further shape our sound and create the sonic textures.

Playing technique is another key element in our signature sound. Half of what makes a good tone, is playing technique. By experimenting with different techniques and incorporating them into our playing.

Of course, songwriting is also a critical part of our signature sound. We've spent years crafting songs that reflect our unique perspective and approach to music. We pay close attention to the chord progressions, song structure, and lyrics we use, all of which contribute to the distinctive sound that defines our music.

Finding our signature sound hasn't been easy, but it has been incredibly rewarding. By experimenting with different gear, playing techniques, and songwriting styles, we've created a sound that is truly our own.
